## Creating Groups and Groupings 

Groups can be a useful tool in Moodle, and can have several functions; It can be used to give students a platform in the forums to interact with one another in a smaller group within the class, or they can be used to allow separate drop boxes for assignments designated to specific groups.

To learn how to create Groups, see the steps below.

### Part 1: Creating a Group

Login to the course in which you would like to create a new group.

Continue to **"Add"** all of the students that you wish to assign to that particular group.

### Part 3: Creating "Groupings"

Once "Groups" have been created and students have been assigned, you have the further options of creating "Groupings."

A grouping is a collection of groups within a course. Using groupings allows you to direct tasks at one or more groups in your course, so that they can work together on the tasks.

In the group creation page, find the menu bar near the top of the page and click on the orange link that reads "Groupings."

Click the "Create grouping" button.

###  

### Next steps,

Provide a name for the "Grouping" \(this can be the same as the group name\).

Create as many Groupings as needed,.

Next, the right "Group" must be associated with the corresponding "Grouping." To do this, find the icon that looks like two people on the far right hand side of the page, underneath the "Edit" heading of the first "Grouping." Select the appropriate group name from the "Potential members" list on the right hand side, and click "Add."

Click "Back to Groupings" when you have finished, and repeat the previous step for the remaining "Groupings."
