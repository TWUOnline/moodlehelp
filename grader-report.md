## Grader Report

All students for your course are located on this page. This is also where you can view, enter, and edit grades.

### What can I do?

On this page you can view specific students by using their first name, last name, or both.

### Turn Editing On

Please note that it is not recommended that you manually enter grades here, as it will cause difficulties in the future. You can, however, override grades that have already been entered into the grader report \(through the assignment drop box\).

### Here's an example

Eight students are connected to this course. Editing is turned on and we have entered their grades \(which is not recommended\). Once your grade book is adequately set up, your course total and overall average will be calculated accurately.

\*Please note that this particular example was not done with a balanced gradebook setup.
