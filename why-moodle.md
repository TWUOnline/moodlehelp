MyCourses is actually a very old version of Moodle and it is no longer supported by the community. It has become a major security risk for our IT systems and it was time for an upgrade.

We decided to stay with Moodle for several reasons:

* TWU has a long history with using Moodle, so the transition will be smoother than if we decided to go with another system.
* Moodle is open source software, and free for us to use. While we still have hosting and maintenance fees, these fees are small compared to fees associated with other learning management systems.
* Moodle is the largest LMS in the Canadian K-12 education market, meaning that many incoming students will be familiar with it.
* Staying with Moodle makes moving course materials from MyCourses into Moodle a relatively simple process.
