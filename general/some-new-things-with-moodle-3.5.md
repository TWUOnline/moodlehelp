# Some New Things with Moodle 3.5

We are so excited for the new upgrade of Moodle and we hope you are enjoying it as much as we are.

There are a few things different to know and we have created a list below. Feel free to browse.

### Where do I find my Administration Block?
One new feature is that we no longer have an "Administration Block", you can now access your 'Actions' at the top right corner of your course page. The 'Actions' looks like this

From the Actions Menu you can:
- Edit Settings
- Turn Editing On
- Course Completion
- Gradebook Setup
- Backup
- Restore
- Import
Or select more to access the full Course Administration list.

### Where are my courses?
There has been some changes with this one, as your new Dashboard is divided into a number of tabs such 'Timeline', 'Courses', 'Future', 'In Progress' and 'Past'. Your new Dashboard should resemble the picture below.

You may also have multiple pages, if you are Faculty or Staff be sure to look for additional pages on your 'Courses' tab.
