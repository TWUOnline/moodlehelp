Note that these instructions can apply to all content on Moodle \(Forums, Dropbox, File, Pages etc.\)  


### Option 1 - Separate Groups \(in a Single Forum\)

The most useful way to incorporate Groups into the forums is to turn on "Separate groups" mode once groups and forum has been created. This limits students to see only the content connected with their particular group. This option gives students the ability to discuss more personal matters, or to plan for a group project without their ideas being seen by others.

  

To incorporate this type of Group:

**Make sure that editing is turned on.**

Scroll to the forum in which you would like to incorporate Groups, and find the icon that looks like the silhouette of a person on the far right hand side of the page. Click on this icon once. You will notice that the icon changes from the silhouette of one person to the silhouette of two people, and it will say "Separate groups \(click to change\)" if you hover over the icon with your mouse. [\(If you have not yet created a forum, click here for instructions.](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=23923)\)

\*Note that the forum will only apply "separate groups" once Groups have been created and students have been assigned to them. \([Learn to create groups here.](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/ArticleDet?ID=26495)\)

### Option 2 - Restricting Access

Another way to incorporate "Separate groups" is to create different content specifically for specific Groups.

An example: You have a class of students and you have added a Directed Study student to see your content, but you have additional content created for that student as well, this option may be helpful for you.

To incorporate this type of Group, do the following while creating your content \(**we'll be using the forum post in this example**\):

Make sure that editing is turned on, and begin the creation of your forum by going to the desired section, and clicking "Add an activity/resource."

From the list that pops up, select "Forum" and then click "Add."

###  

### Once the option is selected.

You can select the group and restrict the visibility. \*Feel free to hover over the eye to see which option is being used.

Then save and display to return to course.

Students in the group you have specified will see the content, if not you can set it to be grayed out or disappear completely.

###  

### Option 3 - Visible Groups

Each group works in their own group, but can also see other groups. \(The other groups' work is read-only.\)

Make sure that editing is turned on.

Scroll to the forum in which you would like to incorporate Groups, and find the icon that looks like the silhouette of a person on the far right hand side of the page. Click on this icon twice. You will notice that the icon changes from the silhouette of one person to the silhouette of two people, and it will say "Visible groups \(click to change\)" if you hover over the icon with your mouse.

\*Note: The pic below shows how each silhouette looks with each group otion.
