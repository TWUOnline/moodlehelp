# Assigning Roles

Professors now have the option of assigning roles such as Teacher Assistant or Non-editing Teacher to their course. Please follow the instructions below to complete this task.

## First, you'll want to open your course.

Select the 'Users' option in your Administration block, next select the 'Enrolled Users' option. **Note: Your Administration block maybe located on the right hand side of your page or it maybe docked on the left side, so location may vary for you the user :-\). **

## Now, your window should open to a page with a list of the students and persons enrolled in your course.

It should look something like this.

1. This option allows you to enrol users.
2. This shows the role of the user, but that X can be sued to alter the 'Student' role of the user in this course. 
3. This option can add addional roles if a user is already enrolled. 
4. The option allows you to search for users who may already be enrol, or maybe check to see if someone might be missing from enrollment. 
5. This shows the first name, last name and contact information. 

You have a couple options to assign the roles of Manager, Non-editing teacher, Teacher's Assistant, Non-Grading Teacher's Assistant and Teacher. The permissions and limitiations for this role is listed below.![](/assets/now--your-window-should-open-to-a-page-with-a-list-of-the-students-and-persons-enrolled-in-your-cour.png)

## Okay back to assigning roles \(Option 1: If you have to add the user to your course\)

Once you have determined that the user you would like to assign a role is not added to the course select the 'Enrol Users' option. It should look something like this. You have to option of assigning the role of Manager,  Non-editing teacher, Teacher's Assistant, Non-Grading Teacher's Assistant and Teacher. Assign the role you wish the user to have and then you want to search their name. Then select 'Enrol'. Once you are done and you've search and identified the roles for your desired users, select 'Finish Enrolling User'

## Congrats you've completed option one sucessfully.

Now, lets say you're interested in option 2.

## Option two:

This might be helpful if maybe you made a mistake and added the wrong role to a user or you wanted to assign multiple roles to a user. This option is for you. Below our user has Teacher role, but what we really want to give is Non-editing Teacher role. So we can simply select the X next to their role to remove that role from the user. To add a different role simply select the 'Assign Role' character indicated below. And choose the appropriate option.

## Congrats! You did option two.

##### Note: If your user is already added to your course **Option One** will not work as the course will already have the user enrolled
