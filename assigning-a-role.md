## Option two:

This might be helpful if maybe you made a mistake and added the wrong role to a user or you wanted to assign multiple roles to a user. This option is for you. Below our user has Teacher role, but what we really want to give is Non-editing Teacher role. So we can simply select the X next to their role to remove that role from the user. To add a different role simply select the 'Assign Role' character indicated below. And choose the appropriate option.
