For the Fall 2017 semester, you may have been enrolled in your courses manually and also through our automated sync process. If you drop a course where you were manually enrolled, your enrolment will not automatically update, but you can unenrol yourself by scrolling to the bottom of the 'Administration' block and clicking 'Unenrol me from this course'.

You will not be able to accidentally unenrol yourself if your registration is current in our database.
