### Use the checkmarks to deselect items that you do not want to back up, or don't change anything to back up everything.

### The next page will take some time to load. Scroll to the bottom to see the confirmation notice, then click 'Continue'.

If the backup failed, start again at the first step.

### You will be taken to a list of all the backups completed for your course. Click the link of the latest backup \(the bottom one\).

This will begin the download process on your local computer. Save the zip file in your 'My Documents' folder \(PC\), or your 'Documents' folder \(Mac\). Linux users will do it their own way regardless of these instructions.

You will need the zipped file when you upload your course to Moodle, so you may need to set your browser to not open downloaded files automatically.

### You are now ready to restore your course in Moodle.

## **NOTE: If your backup is larger that 250MB the backup will not sucessfully restore to Moodle. If your file is too big, try removing 'Course Files' from the back up or delete old content to free up additional space. Happy Restoring!**
