## Making Meta Courses 

Meta-Courses, \(formerly known as Parent Courses\) are your method of amalgamating multiple courses into one location. This is especially helpful when you have multiple courses with the same course content.

### Here are the steps.

First select the course you would like to use as the meta-course. Next, under the Administration block you will see 'Users', under Users select 'Enrollment Methods'

### Next,

On the Enrolment Methods page you can see the amount of users currently in the course.

First, 'Add method', choose 'Course meta link'.

### Linking courses to your meta course.

First you can link courses by entering the course code in the 'Link course' section of the page. Once you have added all the needed course\(s\), add these courses to a new group.

### Your page might look like this when it is completed.

Once you have added the course and chosen your 'Add a group' option you may click the 'Add method' button.

### Congrats! Your Meta-Course is created.

You can now see the new users that have been added, now that you have completed your Meta-course Instructions. We began with five Manual enrolment users. We now have added four courses and in all seven new users were added. This is important to note when creating meta courses as you will want to make sure you keep track and ensure that you have the correct number of users in your course.

### So, you've made a meta course...

Now that your meta-course is created, students can see the meta-course and the respective courses connected to it. This helps everyone to avoid confusion as to why the course they registered for is different from the course they are in. Below is a screen shot of what students will see.
