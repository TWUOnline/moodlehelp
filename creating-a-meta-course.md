## Creating Meta Courses

Meta-Courses, \(formerly known as Parent Courses\) are your method of amalgamating multiple courses into one location. This is especially helpful when you have multiple courses with the same course content.



## Sign in to the course you would like to use as the meta-course. 

In the Administration block for that course, click 'Users', then select 'Enrollment Methods'

## Click 'Add method', then choose 'Course meta link'.

### Type the name of the course you want to link and select it in the search box.

You can repeat the search to add more courses.

You have the option off adding the students from each course to their own group in the meta course, but this is typically not necessary.

### Click 'Add method'. ![](/assets/your-page-might-look-like-this-when-it-is-completed-.png)

### Congrats! Your Meta-Course is created.

You can now see the new users that have been added, now that you have completed your Meta-course Instructions. We began with five Manual enrolment users. We now have added four courses and in all seven new users were added. This is important to note when creating meta courses as you will want to make sure you keep track and ensure that you have the correct number of users in your course.

### So, you've made a meta course...

Now that your meta-course is created, students can see the meta-course and the respective courses connected to it. This helps everyone to avoid confusion as to why the course they registered for is different from the course they are in. Below is a screen shot of what students will see.

## As a final step, you should hide the child courses to avoid confusion.

In the administration block, click 'Edit settings', then change the visibility to 'Hide". then scroll to the bottom of the page to save the change.
