<p>The Moodle Gradebook is a valuable but complex tool. Because of its complexity, eSupport recommends that instructors set up a Gradebook training session for a personalized tutorial. This is especially important for first time users. See the bottom of this page for information on contacting eSupport.</p>

<div class="clarify-step-instructions">
<p>The Gradebook collects and organizes the grades for the class. It automatically pulls in gradable activities (e.g. Assignment Dropboxes, Quizzes) and displays the grades for those activities once you have graded them. The Gradebook will calculate the final grade for each student based on the method you choose; however, it does not submit final course grades to the Office of the Registrar (yet). Using the Gradebook keeps students aware of their progress in the course, motivating them to stay on track.</p>

<p>After creating all the assignments, forums etc for your course, it is now time to setup your Gradebook.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: If you desire Gradebook to reflect grades accurately, please ensure that the &#39;Weights&#39; are equal to 100%. </strong></p>
