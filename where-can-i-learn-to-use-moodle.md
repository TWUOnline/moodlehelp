A system like Moodle is not helpful if nobody knows how to use it, so we have created multiple resources for users to get what they need.

* We have a growing list of [KnowledgeBase Articles](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/?CategoryID=4592).
* If you can't find your answer there, [create a ticket.](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/Requests/ServiceCatalog?CategoryID=5436)
* Send an email to elearning@twu.ca.
* Drop by the Extension office in NW during business hours and speak to one of our e-Support Staff.
