<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. The next page to which you will be redirected automatically is entitled &quot;<b>Adding a new Forum</b>.&quot; On this page, you can select various options for your forum, depending on how you want the forum to be used, using the dropdown menus provided beside each topic. Click the question mark icon next to each setting in each category to find out more about what the setting does. See the steps below for the guidelines to creating a basic forum:</p>

<p>Supply a <b>Name</b> for the forum.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Provide an <b>Introduction</b> to the forum.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><b>Subscribing</b> (see the &quot;<strong>Subscription and tracking</strong>&quot; drop down menu) to a forum sends an email to the subscriber each time a new post is added. If the Instructor does not force everyone to subscribe, students will have to keep track of forum posts on their own. If you choose not to force subscription, let students know that they have the option to subscribe to the forum themselves if they wish to be e-mailed every time a forum post is posted.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Choose whether or not to enable <strong>Read Tracking</strong>. If this option is enabled, users can track which messages have been read or unread in forums and discussions. The Instructor can choose to force a tracking type on a forum using this setting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Once you have adjusted the settings, click <b>Save and display</b> to view the created forum.</p>
	</li> 
	<p>5. Now that you have created a forum, you can add a <b>Discussion Topic</b>.<span class="fluff"> Adding a Discussion Topic allows students to participate in the forum. Without a Discussion Topic, students will see an empty forum. To add a new discussion topic: </span></p>
