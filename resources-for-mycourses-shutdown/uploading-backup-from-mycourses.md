Be sure to "**Save File**" rather than "**Open File**". Though your computer will not be able to read the file, once entered into Moodle the content will transfer appropriately.

That's it, the uploaded file most likely will be stored in your 'Download' folder. Feel free to follow the instructions in the article "**Restore a Course from MyCourses**" for adding this content to your Moodle course.
