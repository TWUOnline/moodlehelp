You may see some items in your course from the previous cohort os students, but we will start from an empty gradebook for this tutorial.

##### In the top row of the gradebook setup screen \(it should display the name of your course\), click 'Edit', then 'Edit Settings'.

### Create Your Categories

##### Scroll to the bottom of Gradebook Setup page and click **"Add Category"**.

Enter a name for the category, such as 'Assignments', or 'Quizzes'.

_Do not_ create categories for single items in your course such as a final exam or participation grade.

* Click "Show More" for more options such as excluding empty grades, and dropping the lowest grade.
* You will not be able to adjust anything in the 'Category total' section.

Click "**Save Changes"**

**Be sure to repeat these steps if you need to create more categories in alignment with your syllabus.**

### Add _all_ of your Assignments.

Creating an 'Assignment' in Moodle does several things:

* it allows you to communicate the details of each assignment to students, including due dates and the value of the assignment;
* it provides a 'dropbox' for students to submit their work to you;
* it provides a grading workflow for you;
* it creates a column in your gradebook

##### Please see the article '[Creating an Assignment Dropbox](https://twonline.gitbooks.io/moodlefaq/content/creating-an-assignment-dropbox.html)' for instructions.



### Add _all_ of your manual grade items.



### 

### Add grade items to categories





### Grade Item Settings

Once you have navigated all the grade items to their correct order you can now set further parameters for your grade items.

First, with Editing On, under the **Actions** column select the dropdown**Edit** menu, select "Edit Settings"

You can add Grade Item parameters and Parent Category on this page. If you have any questions about the items on this page you can click on the question mark located next to each item.

You can hide this item from student's gradebook or lock the item after a certain date, you can also give weight details and assign a category if not done previously.

**\*The Max grade must be altered in the grade item's settings on the course page. Max grades cannot be altered in Gradebook or grade item Setup.**

### Weights and Max Grades

Below is a before and after shot of a gradebook that has been altered to match a syllabus which had a grade weight of 100%.

You can see that all of the grade items are placed randomly in the gradebook. However after some arranging and assigning categories we were able to have a better laid out gradebook.

1. We created a category which is the Research Question Assignment which makes up 20% of the overall mark, however it has 5 assignments which at each 20% of the make up this assignment.
2. The Annotated 
   Bibilography
    makes up 30% of the course grades, it has one assignment associated with it. If we had two assignments associated with this category we would then give the weight 50% each \(we hope you get the picture\).
3. Notice all together the weight for the 
   gradebook
    is 100%, now we are all set to enter grade for students.

Remember: Weights will determine what percentage of the final course grade each activity is worth. Gradebook does not calculate the total of the Weights for you, so you will want to ensure that the weights you enter add up to 100. If not all of the grades for the course are in the Gradebook, you will want the total of the Weights to be whatever percentage is in Gradebook. For example, if 70% of the assignments are in Gradebook, you will want the Weights to add up to 70.

**NOTE: Always make sure you click on Save Changes before navigating away from the Gradebook page.**
