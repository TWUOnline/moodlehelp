<div class="clarify-step-instructions">
<p><strong>We can&#39;t stress this enough, you want to make sure all your syllabus entries are made on your course first before attempting to setup your gradebook. </strong></p>

<p>Ensure that all your assignment parameters are entered correctly during they&#39;re creation, especially with your <strong>Grades</strong> options, if you need to edit anything such as your Max Grade go back to the course and make your corrections there.</p>

<p>Our example below is a perfect example of what your initial gradebook might look like once you create all of your assignments in your course.</p>

<p>Your next steps w ill be to create categories and rearrange each grade items appropriately.</p>

<p>See our example below for a &quot;Before shot&quot; of an example Gradebook:</p>

<div class="clarify-step-instructions">
<p>Below is a before and after shot of a gradebook that has been altered to match a syllabus which had a grade weight of 100%.</p>

<p>You can see that all of the grade items are placed randomly in the gradebook. However after some arranging and assigning categories we were able to have a better laid out gradebook.</p>

<ol>
	<li>We created a category which is the Research Question Assignment which makes up 20% of the overall mark, however it has 5 assignments which at each 20% of the make up this assignment.</li>
	<li>The Annotated Bibilography makes up 30% of the course grades, it has one assignment associated with it. If we had two assignments associated with this category we would then give the weight 50% each (we hope you get the picture).</li>
	<li>Notice all together the weight for the gradebook is 100%, now we are all set to enter grade for students.</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Remember:</span> Weights will determine what percentage of the final course grade each activity is worth. Gradebook does not calculate the total of the Weights for you, so you will want to ensure that the weights you enter add up to 100. If not all of the grades for the course are in the Gradebook, you will want the total of the Weights to be whatever percentage is in Gradebook. For example, if 70% of the assignments are in Gradebook, you will want the Weights to add up to 70.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Always make sure you click on Save Changes before navigating away from the Gradebook page.</strong></p>
