We will keep MyCourses accessible for the 2017/2018 academic year. In May, we will hide courses from student view, although faculty and staff will be able to see hidden courses.

If you would like to download your work from MyCourses, you are welcome to do so, but please do not download resources or files that you did not create. Articles posted by faculty should be accessed through the library website.

Downloading and distributing material that you did not create, or is not openly licensed,  is a violation of the author's copyright and is illegal.
