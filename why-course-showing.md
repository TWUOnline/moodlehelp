There are several reasons that your course might not be showing in Moodle.

* Your instructor has hidden the course while they are updating it.
* Your dashboard is only showing some of your courses. 
  * scroll to the bottom of the page and click 'Show all courses'
* You are on the waitlist for the course.
  * Please contact the office of the Registrar.
* You are not up-to-date on your tuition payments.
  * Once you are up-to-date, your status will be updated.
* You registered very recently and our system has not synchronized yet.
  * We synchronize Moodle with Jenzabar \(our database of registrations\) at 1:30 pm and 6:30 pm weekdays.
