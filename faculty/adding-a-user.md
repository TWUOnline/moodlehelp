# Adding a User

Students can only be enroled in courses by the Registrar's Office.

Users with the following roles can add users to Moodle courses.

### Managers can enrol:

* Manager
* Teacher
* Non-editing teacher
* Full TA
* Non-editing TA
* Non-grading TA

### Teachers can enrol:

* Teacher
* Non-editing teacher
* Full TA
* Non-editing TA
* Non-grading TA

No other users can enrol other users.

We cannot create accounts for users who are not members of the TWU Community.

## Select the 'Users' option in your Administration block, then select the 'Enrolled Users' option.

Note: Your Administration block maybe located on the right hand side of your page or it maybe docked on the left side, so location may vary for you the user :-\).

## Click 'Enrol' beside the user's name, and then 'Finish enrolling users'.

Teachers can only enrol users into the role of 'Teacher', 'Non-Editing teacher', or one of the three 'Teaching Assistant' options.

Students must be enrolled through the registrar.
