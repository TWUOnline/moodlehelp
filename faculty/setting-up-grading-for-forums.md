# Setting up Grading for Forums

You may notice that your current forum may not have an entry in your gradebook. If you are hoping to make your gradebook a gradable part of your course please follow these next steps. 

In the forum settings you will need to scroll down to the **"Ratings"** option.

The default setting is an Aggregate type "**No Ratings"**

You want to change the aggregation to the appropriate type for your gradebook. Next, choose the appropriate type, usually "Point" but you may also choose "Scale"
