# Creating an Assignment Dropbox

The most commonly used Activities, Assignment Dropboxes allow students to submit assignments online. This is convenient for Instructors, as it eliminates the possibility of losing a student’s paper and as it enables students to submit their assignments immediately. It also connects to gradebook so students can see their grades once they are corrected.

## Remember: Always turn editing on.

1. Supply a Name for the Assignment. _Make sure it is something that your students will recognize_.
2. Enter a description of the assignment.

   **This is where you should publish the details and requirements of the assignment.**

3. Be sure to add any necessary attachments as well.

   **Attachments might include datasets, example submissions, or other resources that students need to complete the assignment.**

## Edit 'Grade' settings.

You can change the maximum grade to align with your marking rubric.

You may also add the assignment to the appropriate 'Grade category' using the dropdown menu.

## Other options for your assignment dropbox.

You may set the parameters for your assignment dropbox using the following options. You can set the due date and cut off date, submission type, add the max grade and assign it to a category in your gradebook, etc.

**Note** you must select a time from the 24 hour clock, it is often convenient to make an assignment due at 23:55, or 11:55PM, on the date that it is due to avoid due date mix ups for students.

Once options are selected click **Save and return to course or display** to preview your drop box.
